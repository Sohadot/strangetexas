  <h1 class="article-title">Frozen in Time: The Echoes of Texas Law</h1>
  <div class="article-divider"></div>
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>Laws are more than just rules; they are reflections of the people and the moments that created them. In Texas, the legal code is a landscape of ghosts, containing echoes of a wilder and more desperate time. These statutes remain on the books long after the world they tried to govern has vanished, leaving us with strange remnants of a past that refuses to be forgotten.</p>
    <h2>The Sacred Right of the Herd</h2>
    <p>In the nineteenth century, cattle were not just animals. They were life, wealth, and identity. This explains why milking another person's cow remains a crime in Texas today. It was a law born of a ranching culture where every drop of resource was a personal claim. Similarly, the prohibition against marking or graffitiing a cow protects a system of branding that dates back generations. These laws are silent guardians of a world where your neighbor's property was a boundary you did not cross without consequence.</p>
    <h2>The Hunter at the Window</h2>
    <p>One of the most peculiar laws prohibits shooting a buffalo from the second story of a hotel. It is a sentence that invites the imagination to fill in the blanks. It speaks of a time when massive herds moved through the streets of growing towns, and the opportunism of a hunter with a room and a view was a real enough problem to require a written ban. Today, the buffalo are mostly gone, but the law waits in the dusty corners of the books, a ghost of the frontier.</p>
    <h2>The War of the Wire</h2>
    <p>In some counties, carrying wire cutters was once a serious offense, a direct result of the fence-cutting wars of the 1880s. It was a period of lethal conflict over the invention of barbed wire, which carved the open range into private pieces. Carrying a pair of cutters was not just a practical choice. It was a declaration of war against the new order of the land. The wars ended long ago, but the legal scars remain, reminding us of how fiercely humans will fight over a line in the dirt.</p>
    <h2>The Mystery of the Feather Duster</h2>
    <p>In the town of Clarendon, it is technically illegal to clean a public building with a feather duster. No one remembers why. There is no record of the scandal or the incident that made a cleaning tool a matter for the authorities. It sits in the municipal code as a perfect piece of human absurdity, a law without a memory, waiting for a violation that will likely never come. It is a reminder that sometimes, the gears of human logic turn in ways that eventually lose all meaning.</p>
